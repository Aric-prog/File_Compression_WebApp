## File_Compression_WebApp

This is our Final Project for our 3rd Semester Analysis of Algorithms course. 

To run this project, you would need to create a virtual environment in python 
```python
virtualenv venv
```

After that, you would need to install all the libraries that are used within this projects,

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are ready to go!, the last thing to do is to run the flask with

```python
flask run
```
